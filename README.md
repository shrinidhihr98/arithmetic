# Math

Here is a simple game app that you can use to practice your arithmetic skills!

The game proceeds by asking you ten arithmetic questions, for you which you type in the answer. After the ten questions, you can match results and start again. 

The game has addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, permutations and combinations built into it, although, the permutations and combinations are disabled by default. You can also set the number ranges to increase difficulty. 
Note: the project is named arithmetic, but the app is called Math.
